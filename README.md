# Re-identification-project
Install the required librabries and packages.
Place the model and video files: Make sure the YOLO model file (best (2).pt in the example) and your video file (/15sec_input_720p.mp4 in the example) are in the same directory as the script, or provide the full paths to them in the code.
Run the tracking script: Execute the following Python code. This script initializes the YOLO model and DeepSort tracker, then processes the video frame by frame, performing detection and tracking. The output video with tracked objects will be saved as output_tracked_video_deepsort.mp4.
